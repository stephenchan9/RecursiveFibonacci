
#Recursive Fibonacci

This is a continuation of the fibonacci program requiring a user to generate a fibonacci sequence.
The program prompts user to enter a value and recursively calculates the fibonacci values of all numbers up to that value.

Design: 
A single procedure is used to generate the fibonacci sequence and calls itself for each iteration. Jumps are used to move to a specific scenario depending on the value.
The user's input is saved and immediately starts a timer that tracks the time it takes for the caluclation of the total sum for the values. The timer stops when the procedure is finished with the calculations.
Program loops to the beginning of the program until user decides to quit.


How to run the program.

1. Build Program.
2. Enter User value to calculate the sum of fibonacci numbers to that value.
3. Enter any key to calculate another value or enter q or Q to exit program.
